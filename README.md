# ðŸ›’ SmartCart: Purchase Pattern Analytics & Customer Segmentation Pipeline

**SmartCart** is a production-grade retail analytics pipeline designed to help businesses extract insights from invoice-level data. This project enables customer segmentation, purchase behavior analysis, and KPI tracking using automated ETL workflows, machine learning models, and dynamic BI dashboards.

---

## Business Problem

Retail and e-commerce companies often struggle to:
- Identify high-value vs. churn-prone customers
- Forecast product demand with accuracy
- Track real-time sales and operational KPIs across categories
- Automate insights without manual intervention

**SmartCart** addresses these challenges through a scalable analytics solution.

---

## Project Objectives

- Segment customers using behavioral metrics like RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- Forecast product demand and customer churn using predictive modeling
- Visualize key business KPIs through interactive Power BI/Tableau dashboards
- Automate data ingestion, transformation, and analytics workflows for scalability
